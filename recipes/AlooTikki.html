    <h4>Description: </h4>
    <p>This is a delicious vegan Indian recipe where vegetables and chickpeas are served over small potato cakes. It works well as a starter for four, or as a vegetarian and vegan main for two. Place the potato cakes on a plate, serve the chickpeas on top, and don't forget the sauces! Recipes for Indian sauces - coriander sauce and tamarind sauce - are on this site. Finally, sprinkle with some fresh coriander leaves and a few thin slices of fresh onion.</p>
